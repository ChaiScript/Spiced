# Documentation Status

None.

# Level Editing

You can use the [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) to edit levels.

# Example Code

The [sample_game](sample_game) contains a simple game involving trading of goods and some adventure game story elements.

Make sure you talk to all of the characters multiple times, as new story elements
become available.

To learn about the engine, I suggest you look at the [sample_game/spiced.chai](sample_game/spiced.chai) source file. Then open the 
[sample_game/resources](sample_game/resources) folder and look at the .tmx map files. You can open them with Tiled then export them as json files,
overwriting the existing json files in the directory. Relaunch the game and see the differences.
